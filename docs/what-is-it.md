# What is Flareutils?

Flareutils is a small collection of utility classes and functions meant to make your Cloudflare development experience smoother.

Flareutils is subject to [the MIT License](/license), which means, if you believe the offered classes/functions don't meet your needs, you are free to fork it, suggest changes via a [pull request](https://github.com/helloimalastair/FlareUtils/compare), or just build something inspired by flareutils that fits your exact needs. I won't judge. :wink:

Note, this documentation acts as a suplement to the Typedoc annotations present in the code. Using a tool like VSCode IntelliSense, you can have your IDE show you the exact documentation for a function/class as you type.

Flareutils consists of **6** separate utilities:

- [BetterKV](/betterkv/)
- [Isaac](/isaac/)
- [MailChannels](/mailchannels/)
- [Phonetic](/phonetic/)
- [Stubby](/stubby/)
- [Temra](/temra/)
